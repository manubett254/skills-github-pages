# Audio-Based Age and Gender Predictor

**Description:**  
This project uses audio signals to predict the age and gender of a speaker based on voice patterns. It leverages advanced machine learning models trained on acoustic features extracted from audio files. The application aims to enhance voice recognition systems and create more personalized user experiences.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- Librosa (for audio feature extraction)  
- TensorFlow/Keras (for building machine learning models)  
- NumPy & Pandas (for data processing)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)  

**Key Features:**  
- Extracts key features from audio data, such as pitch, tone, and MFCCs.  
- Trains a deep learning model to classify gender and predict age group.  
- Provides accurate predictions with real-time processing capabilities.  
- Offers insights into voice-based biometric applications.

**Live Demo:** Coming Soon
